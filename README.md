Project Overview: Caffeine – An Emerging Aquatic Pollutant
Introduction
Caffeine, a widely consumed stimulant, is increasingly recognized as an emerging aquatic pollutant. It enters marine environments primarily through wastewater and has been detected at measurable concentrations in coastal ecosystems (Baracchini et al., 2023). Although typically present at low levels, caffeine can have significant biological effects on marine organisms, including disruptions to behavior, metabolism, and stress responses (Li et al., 2020). This study investigates the effects of caffeine on the shore crab Hemigrapsus oregonensis, an intertidal species native to the Pacific Northwest and a known bioindicator of environmental stress.

Hypothesis and Objectives
We hypothesized that caffeine exposure would induce behavioral and physiological stress in H. oregonensis, with more pronounced effects at higher concentrations. The study aimed to: (1) assess behavioral stress using righting time assays, (2) measure metabolic activity using resazurin dye assays, (3) evaluate internal physiological stress via hemolymph lactate levels, and (4) monitor mortality across treatments.

Methods
Crabs were exposed for two weeks to three treatment levels of caffeine: Low (5 μg/L), Medium (15 μg/L), and High (20 μg/L). Each treatment tank housed six crabs in aerated seawater at a controlled temperature of 13°C. Weekly assessments were conducted as follows:

Righting time was recorded by inverting each crab and timing how long it took to return to an upright position.
Resazurin assays measured cellular respiration; one crab per treatment was placed in a resazurin solution, and absorbance was measured over 1.5 hours.
Hemolymph samples were drawn from another crab per group and analyzed for lactate, a biomarker of physiological stress.
Mortality was tracked throughout the study.

Results
Mortality occurred in all groups, with the highest in the high-dose treatment. Righting time generally increased from Week 1 to Week 2 in the low and high groups, suggesting cumulative behavioral stress. In contrast, the medium group showed improved righting times, indicating possible acclimation.
Resazurin assays revealed high metabolic activity in Week 1, particularly in the high-dose group, followed by reduced activity in Week 2—likely due to metabolic fatigue.
Hemolymph lactate levels were highest in the control and high-dose groups across both weeks. Elevated levels in the control group may be due to handling stress, while the high-dose group showed a clear physiological response to caffeine.

Conclusion
The findings support the hypothesis that caffeine acts as a stressor for H. oregonensis, affecting behavior, metabolism, and survival. These effects were dose- and time-dependent, with some evidence of physiological acclimation at moderate concentrations. Given the species’ role as a bioindicator, these results raise concerns about the ecological impacts of caffeine in marine environments and underscore the need for further research on chronic, low-dose exposure to this pollutant.
