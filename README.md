# Project Synopsis

Background & Applied Relevance
Caffeine, a widely consumed psychoactive compound, has emerged as an environmental pollutant due to its increasing detection in marine ecosystems. Often entering aquatic environments through wastewater discharge, caffeine has been shown to impact aquatic life even at low concentrations. The shore crab Hemigrapsus oregonensis, a native intertidal species of the Pacific Northwest and known bioindicator, presents a suitable model for evaluating the ecological effects of such contaminants.
Hypothesis
We hypothesized that environmentally relevant concentrations of caffeine would induce measurable behavioral and physiological stress responses in H. oregonensis, with higher concentrations causing more severe effects.
Objectives
The study aimed to:
1.	Determine the effects of caffeine exposure on crab neuromuscular behavior using righting time assays.
2.	Measure changes in cellular respiration and metabolic activity through resazurin dye assays.
3.	Evaluate physiological stress using lactate levels extracted from hemolymph samples.
4.	Assess crab mortality across varying caffeine concentrations.
Experimental Design
Three treatment groups were established using different caffeine concentrations (Low: 5 μg/L, Medium: 15 μg/L, High: 20 μg/L). Crabs were exposed to these treatments for two weeks, with assays repeated weekly.
•	Righting time measured behavioral response and neurological function.
•	Resazurin assay assessed metabolic activity via cellular respiration.
•	Hemolymph analysis evaluated internal stress via lactate levels.
•	Mortality was monitored as an indicator of overall health and survival.
Summary of Findings
The results supported the hypothesis that caffeine acts as a stressor in H. oregonensis.
•	Righting time increased over time in most groups, indicating cumulative behavioral stress.
•	Resazurin assay showed a spike in metabolic activity in Week 1, followed by a decline in Week 2—suggesting metabolic fatigue.
•	Lactate analysis indicated elevated stress in both high-dose and control groups, the latter likely due to handling-related stressors.
•	Mortality was highest in the high-dose group but occurred in all treatments, indicating that even low caffeine levels may negatively affect crab health.
Conclusion
This study demonstrates that even environmentally relevant caffeine concentrations can impact the behavior, physiology, and survival of H. oregonensis. These findings highlight the need for more extensive research on caffeine's ecological effects and suggest the potential for broader implications on marine food webs and ecosystem health.
